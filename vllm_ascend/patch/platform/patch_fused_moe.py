# Patch vllm's FusedMoE factory to use AscendMoERunner by default.
#
# vllm's FusedMoE is a factory function (not a class). deepseek_v2 and other
# models do `from vllm.model_executor.layers.fused_moe import FusedMoE` and
# call it directly, so we must patch the binding in the package __init__ as
# well as the layer module before any model is imported.
#
# Import order in worker.__init__:
#   1. adapt_patch()  ->  this file runs  ->  FusedMoE patched
#   2. from vllm_ascend import ops
#   3. model loading  ->  deepseek_v2 imported  ->  gets patched FusedMoE  ✓
